I am **Zhirui "Ray/Redk" Bian (卞直瑞)**, a master's student in the Computer and Information Science (CIS) Department at the **University of Pennsylvania (Penn)**.

My current research focuses on **natural-language processing and large-scale language models** under the supervision of [Prof.&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). Prior to joining Penn CIS, I completed the **Environmental Building Design (EBD)** program at Penn's Weitzman School of Design, where I was advised by [Prof.&nbsp;William&nbsp;Braham](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/william-w-braham) on **environmental simulation and performance-driven architectural design**.

I received my **B.Eng.** degree from **Nanjing University**, China.

My interdisciplinary background bridges **computer science, building science, and computational design**, and I am passionate about developing intelligent systems that make our built environment more sustainable and responsive.
